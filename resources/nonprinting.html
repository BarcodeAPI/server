							Designed with scale in mind, the BarcodeAPI.org[1] web server was built to handle even the
							most demanding environments. With some instances having generated over 100 million barcodes,
							the server can be used for nearly and use-cases. Using their favorite web browser a user can
							navigate to an elegant website and quickly create barcodes of many different types. For
							advanced users who wish to automate the generation of barodes, the server also features a
							full rendering API via the HTTP protocol; this is useful where barcode generation libraries
							might not be available or where system resources are limited.

2 API Server
The server will generate a barcode for any content passed to the /api endpoint; this can be done using a
web browser, fetched through a user script, or even simply with cURL.
curl / wget
curl https://barcodeapi.org/api/A_Barcode > gen.png
wget -o gen.png https://barcodeapi.org/api/A_Barcode
HTML / JS
<img id=“barcode”/>
<script>
document.getElementById("barcode").src = "https://barcodeapi.org/api/A_Barcode";
</script>
2.1 Type Selection
The API offers two types of barcode type selection, automatic or manual; users of the web-based
interface might prefer the barcode type be selected based on what they type, while direct callers of
the API might want to have control over which barcode format they will receive back from the server.
2.1.1 Automatic Type Detection
When calling the API endpoint without specifying an explicit code type the server will make its best
judgment as to which code type will be best suited for the supplied data.
curl https://barcodeapi.org/api/abc123
curl https://barcodeapi.org/api/auto/abc123

2.1.2 Manual Type Selection
A specific barcode type may be requested by using the type string in the request URL.
curl https://barcodeapi.org/api/128/abc123
curl https://barcodeapi.org/api/qr/abc123
2.2 Web Server
The server comes with a minimal set of static HTML and Javascript files that allow users to generate
barcodes in their web browser with ease. The UI allows users to quickly download, print, or copy the
images for use in other applications.
2.2.1 Multi-Barcode Generation
Some users will want to generate a large number of barcodes with one request - a basic JavaScript utility
is provided at /multi.html which will generate as many images as requested then prepare the file to be
printed.

2.2.2 Forced Redirect
The server provides a set of static resources served from the root url of the server, in the event a request
is made which is not targeted directly at the API nor references a known resources, a 403 redirect will be
provided to send the send request to the API handler.
$ curl --head https://barcodeapi.org/abc123
...
Location: https://barcodeapi.org/api/auto/abc123
2.3 Response Headers
The server will add several headers related to the barcode including the type and encoded contents.
$ curl --head https://barcodeapi.org/api/auto/abc123
...
X-Barcode-Type: Code128
BarcodeAPI.org Technical User Manual, v.PRERELEASE 4 / 14 ↑
X-Barcode-Content: abc123
Content-Type: image/png;charset=utf-8
Content-Disposition: filename=abc123.png
Cache Control
In an attempt to minimize the number of requests
Cache-Control: max-age=86400, public
Error Headers
In the event of a render error, an additional header will be available containing details about the exception.
X-Error-Message: (exception.toString())
3 Barcode Generation
The primary purpose of the server is barcode image generation behind a RESTful endpoint. The server
has been designed to support a wide variety of barcode types and offers additional configuration options
for most.
3.1 Barcode Types
A list of all supported barcodes types is available by calling the /types/
