				Over 1 billion barcodes served!
				<br />
				<br />
				BarcodeAPI.org originated in 2017 as an open-source SQA (Software Quality Assurance) tool
				designed for generating test barcodes. Its initial deployment within Amazon.com quickly
				propelled its popularity, attracting a diverse global user base. Over the past 7+ years,
				BarcodeAPI.org has evolved into a cornerstone for barcode generation, serving millions of
				barcodes monthly across various industries and applications.
				<br />
				<br />
				In 2024, in response to growing demand and to sustain the service's development and
				operational needs, we introduced a new phase with paid subscription options. This strategic
				move ensures continued accessibility for users who generate a limited number of barcodes
				while offering a subscription model for those with high-volume needs. This model allows us
				to maintain our commitment to open-source principles while ensuring sustainability and
				ongoing innovation.
				<br />
				<br />
				BarcodeAPI.org remains dedicated to being your premier online resource for all barcode
				needs. Whether you're testing software, managing inventory, or integrating barcodes into
				innovative applications, we are here to support your journey with reliable, scalable, and
				user-friendly barcode generation solutions.
				<br />
				<br />
				Join us as we continue to shape the future of barcode technology together!
