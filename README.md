# BarcodeAPI.org

The BarcodeAPI.org server was designed to provide an easy-to-use barcode image generation API served through the HTTP protocol.

By serving images with this approach, any application where barcode generation libraries may not exist or resources may be limited can continue to serve barcode images, provided network access is available.

The WebUI is also designed to be responsive, allowing users to generate barcodes that can be scanned directly from their web browser or downloaded after testing.

Comprehensive documentation regarding server capabilities is built directly into the server, ensuring users have access to all necessary information for efficient usage.
